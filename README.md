## Introduction

Welcome to Aspen Capital's Software Engineer challenge. This assignment will help us better assess your technical and design skills. We recommend that you focus on the requirements listed below, and if time permitting, work on any additional features of your own choosing. These additional features can be new, functional pieces within the application, or even relevant design artifacts. It should be fun and highlight what you think your best skills are.

## Background

Your task is to implement an application that plays the card game of [War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game))

Use the rules [here](https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/war/)

## Requirements

### High Level

* Create a RESTful service with two endpoints:

	* An endpoint to start a game. Two simulated players will play out the game.
	* An endpoint to get lifetime wins for each player stored in a database.

* You should include some basic tests along with the application code.

### Technical

* The service can be created in the language/framework of your choice. However, please do not reuse boilerplate
  code from another project as this makes it hard to see the pieces you have created which is a goal
  of this exercise.
* You can use any db technology you like.

Bonuses for providing:

* A Docker image or a link to a cloud deployment of the service.
* A simple UI showing the game being played.
* You can also implement variations of the basic game if you have time.

## Submission
* Your submission should be accessible in a public git repository that includes a README.md with all the pertinent information of how to run your application. 
The expectation is that we can easily follow the steps provided and run the application without any guesswork.
* If your submission does include additional artifacts that are not represented within the repository - the README should provide information on how to retrieve and access these items.

* Details on anything further that you would like to achieve given more time, including any trade-offs that you may have made.

Good luck and thank you for your time - we look forward to seeing your submission.
